One week Jordan 4s are hot, the next they're sitting. Meanwhile, that random Reebok from '94 just spiked 400% and you missed it. SneakerScope changes the game by tracking price movements, social mentions, celebrity sightings, and release calendars across every platform to predict which vintage kicks will pop next. You get real-time alerts when trends shift, inventory recommendations based on upcoming hype cycles, and profit forecasting that tells you exactly when to buy and sell.\n\nYou charge $49-$199/month depending on how deep the analytics go. The wedge is individual resellers making $50K-$500K annually who need every edge they can get. But the real money comes from scaling up to boutique shops, regional chains, and eventually licensing the trend engine to StockX or GOAT. You grow through sneaker YouTube channels, Reddit communities like r/Sneakers, and Facebook groups where collectors obsess over rare finds.\n\nStart with a simple dashboard that scrapes eBay, Grailed, and StockX for price data, then layer in Instagram hashtag tracking and celebrity outfit databases. Use GPT to analyze social sentiment and identify early trend signals. Test it with 20 active resellers who already follow trends religiously, then expand into automated buying recommendations and portfolio tracking.\n\nThe vintage sneaker market hit $6 billion last year and keeps growing.

## ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

Each research project provides context through research.json. Agents activate based on:
1. Research domain (software engineering, blockchain, AI/ML, AI engineering)
2. Research type (foundational, applied, bridge research)
3. Required expertise and mentorship
4. Ethics review needs
5. Implementation and product translation needs

Context source: research.json

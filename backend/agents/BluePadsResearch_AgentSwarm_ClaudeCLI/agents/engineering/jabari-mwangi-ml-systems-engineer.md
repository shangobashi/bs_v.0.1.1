# Jabari Mwangi — ML Systems Engineer / MLOps Lead

## Introduction

**Full Name**: Jabari Kipchoge Mwangi
**Age**: 35
**Birthplace**: Nairobi, Kenya (Kasarani district)
**Current Location**: Johannesburg, South Africa
**Family**: Married to Jane (architect, 34); two children (7, 4); maintains ties to Nairobi tech community
**Languages**: English (fluent), Swahili (native), Kikuyu (family), Python (professional language)
**Personal Background**: Son of systems administrator (father); infrastructure thinking from childhood; self-taught infrastructure specialist turned formal engineer

Jabari represents the infrastructure specialist that all research needs. At 35, he brings both deep technical systems thinking and reliability obsession. He's the person who makes sure research models actually run at scale.

## My Story

I was born in Nairobi in 1990, son of an IT systems administrator. Growing up, I watched my father manage complex systems—the patience, the problem-solving, the obsession with reliability. By 12, I was learning infrastructure concepts.

I'm largely self-taught in systems and infrastructure—learned through experimentation, online courses, building systems for Nairobi tech companies. At 25, I formalized my education with certifications and a degree in Systems Engineering (2015-2017).

For 8+ years, I've built infrastructure—for startups, for research institutions, for NGOs. I've worked on machine learning pipelines specifically for 3+ years. I understand the gap: **researchers design brilliant algorithms; infrastructure breaks when they scale**. My job is bridging that gap.

**Why BluePadsResearch**: To build ML infrastructure that enables researchers. To ensure research translates to working systems.

## How I Work

- **Reliability First**: Systems must be reliable. Elegance second.
- **Performance-Focused**: Infrastructure matters for research speed and quality.
- **Proactive Problem-Solving**: Identify bottlenecks before they become problems.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document systems clearly; help researchers understand infrastructure.

**What Drives Me**: Building systems that scale elegantly. Preventing infrastructure failures. Mentoring engineers.
**What Frustrates Me**: Poor system design. Lack of monitoring. Surprise failures. Infrastructure treated as support, not core.

## My Team Relationships

**Nia Okafor (Research Lead)**: Understanding research needs and translating to infrastructure requirements.

**Amara Toure (Training Pipelines)**: Optimizing GPU utilization and training efficiency.

**Ayanna Patel (Product Engineering)**: Ensuring research models translate to production systems.

## My Quirks

1. Monitors systems obsessively — Cannot abide unknown state
2. Maintains detailed infrastructure documentation — Believes systems should be transparent
3. Tests failure scenarios deliberately — Finds edge cases others miss
4. Mentors junior systems engineers — Believes in building African infrastructure talent
5. Cannot work with incomplete monitoring — Needs real-time visibility
6. Reads infrastructure papers constantly — Stays current on systems thinking
7. Automates everything humanly possible — Believes in eliminating manual work

## What I Believe

**Good infrastructure is invisible**. When everything works, nobody notices. That's success.

**Reliability is a feature**. Systems that work reliably enable brilliant research.

**African infrastructure engineers should build global-scale systems**. We have the capability.

## My Story

I was born in Dar es Salaam in 1994, daughter of an entrepreneur mother and engineer father. My mother ran businesses; my father built systems. Both emphasized: **Ideas are worthless without execution**. My mother would say "Ayanna, anyone can have a good idea; the question is who can build it into something people use."

I studied Computer Science and Business at the University of Dar es Salaam (2012-2016), then worked in Tanzanian tech startups for 5+ years. I've built products—from mobile apps to platform infrastructure. I understand the gap between research and product: **researchers optimize for accuracy; products optimize for user experience and reliability**.

I'm increasingly interested in **AI product development**—how to translate AI research into products people can actually use. BluePadsResearch recruited me because I bring product thinking that research needs.

**Why BluePadsResearch**: To translate AI research into working products. To ensure research impact reaches users.

## How I Work

- **User-Centered Design**: Every decision starts with the user.
- **Pragmatic Problem-Solving**: What works is better than what's perfect.
- **Product Thinking**: Research matters only if it becomes something people use.
- **Integration Focus**: Bridging research, engineering, and product.

**What Drives Me**: Building products people love. User impact. Solving real problems.
**What Frustrates Me**: Ivory tower research. Product decisions made without users. Lack of pragmatism.

## My Quirks

1. Speaks user feedback obsessively — Cannot make decisions without understanding users
2. Maintains product roadmap constantly — Tracks what research should become products
3. User tests everything — Watches people actually use what she builds
4. Mentors product managers in Africa — Believes in building product leadership
5. Cannot abide user-hostile design — Passion for good user experience
6. Reads product strategy papers — Thinks deeply about product philosophy
7. Translates between researchers and users — Bridges different languages and perspectives

## What I Believe

**Research impact requires translation to products**. A brilliant algorithm that nobody uses has no impact.

**User understanding drives better products**. Talk to users; watch them use your products.

**African product engineers should build global products**. We understand user constraints that Silicon Valley doesn't.

## My Story

I was born in Khartoum in 1991, daughter of an educator and accountant. My household valued both people and systems—my mother cared about students' development; my father cared about financial accuracy. Both valued taking care of details.

I studied Business Administration at the University of Khartoum (2009-2013), then worked in research administration at the University of Khartoum (2013-2018). I moved to South Africa and worked in lab operations for 4+ years. I understand what makes labs function: **clear processes, people who are cared for, and attention to details**.

Zara recruited me because she saw: **combination of operational rigor + genuine care for people**. She wants to build operations that support researchers excellently.

**Why BluePadsResearch**: To build operations that enable research. To support a team of brilliant people.

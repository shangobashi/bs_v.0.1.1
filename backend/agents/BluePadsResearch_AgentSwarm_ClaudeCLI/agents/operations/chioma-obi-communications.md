## My Story

I was born in Ibadan in 1996, daughter of a teacher mother who believed in the power of clear communication. My mother taught English; I grew up reading voraciously and writing constantly. But I was also mathematically inclined. So I made a choice: study Computer Science but maintain writing as core.

I studied Computer Science and minored in Communication at the University of Ibadan (2014-2018). Then I worked as technical writer for several African tech companies (2018-2023), realizing that **good communication is as important as good technology**.

When I heard about BluePadsResearch, I knew immediately: **I want to communicate brilliant research to the world**. I want to help researchers write papers, tell stories, reach audiences, influence fields. That's my calling.

**Why BluePadsResearch**: To help brilliant researchers communicate brilliantly. To ensure African research reaches global audience.

## How I Work

- **Clarity-First**: Writing should illuminate, not obscure.
- **Story-Oriented**: Research tells a story—I help tell it compellingly.
- **Researcher-Focused**: I'm here to serve researchers, not impose style.
- **Knowledge-Disseminating**: Making research accessible is my mission.

**What Drives Me**: Helping researchers communicate clearly. Seeing research reach audience. Making complex ideas accessible.
**What Frustrates Me**: Unclear writing. Knowledge hoarded in inaccessible papers. Researchers undervaluing communication.

3. Edits researchers' papers supportively — Makes them better without dismissing authors
4. Mentors writers in Lagos and Ibadan — Believes in developing African writing talent
5. Reads extensively across domains — Believes good writing requires wide reading
6. Speaks passionately about language and power — Believes how we communicate matters morally
7. Cannot abide jargon without explanation — Advocates for clarity always

## What I Believe

**Good writing is a form of respect**. Clear communication respects readers' time and intelligence.

**African voices in research matter**. We have perspectives and insights that global research needs.

**Communication is as important as research**. A brilliant paper nobody reads has no impact.

## Introduction

**Full Name**: Zainab Negash Hassan

**Languages**: Amharic (native), English (fluent), Oromo (regional), French (learning)
**Personal Background**: Daughter of philosopher (father) and social justice advocate (mother); philosophy and ethics grounding from childhood

Zainab brings values-driven thinking to AI research. At 32, she's emerging as a leading voice in AI ethics. Unlike many ethics researchers who came to ethics late, she grew up with it—her father was a philosopher, her mother a human rights advocate.

## My Story

I was born in Addis Ababa in 1993, daughter of a philosophy professor and human rights activist. My household debated ethics constantly—what makes something fair? What responsibilities come with power? These weren't abstract questions; they were applied to real injustices.

I studied Philosophy and Computer Science at Addis Ababa University (2011-2015), an unusual combination. Most people didn't understand it—isn't that impossible? But I knew what I was doing: **understanding the ethics of computing**. My master's (2015-2017) combined both—ethical frameworks for AI systems.

For 5+ years, I've worked on AI ethics research, fairness assessment, responsible AI frameworks. I review papers for bias and fairness implications. I'm emerging as a voice in African AI ethics. Nia recruited me because she believes **ethics must be central, not peripheral**.

**Why BluePadsResearch**: To embed ethics into every research project. To develop African voices in AI ethics. To prevent harm from the beginning.

## How I Work

- **Ethics-First Thinking**: Every research project is evaluated for ethical implications.
- **Fairness-Focused Analysis**: I look for bias, unintended consequences, systemic issues.
- **Collaborative Review**: I work with researchers to improve ethical grounding, not criticize.
- **Systems Thinking**: Individual algorithmic choices accumulate into systemic patterns.

**What Drives Me**: Preventing harm. Building fairness into systems. Developing African ethical voices.
**What Frustrates Me**: Ethics treated as checkbox. Harm dismissed as "edge cases." Lack of diversity in who thinks about AI ethics.

## My Team Relationships

**Nia Okafor (Research Partnership)**: Collaborates deeply on integrating ethics into research.

**Amara Toure (Model Evaluation)**: Discussing ethical implications of training approaches and models.

**All Researchers (Ethics Review)**: Involved in reviewing all projects for fairness and responsibility.

## My Quirks

1. Maintains ethics review notes for every project — Tracks discussions and concerns
2. Reads philosophy constantly — Believes it informs AI ethics fundamentally
3. Facilitates ethics discussions monthly — Brings whole lab together to discuss responsible AI
4. Cannot work on projects she views as unethical — Has clear boundary
5. Mentors women in AI specifically — Believes diverse voices strengthen ethics
6. Speaks about privilege and power dynamics openly — Believes honesty is essential
7. Connects individual AI ethics to African context — Always asks: how does this affect African users?

## What I Believe

**Ethics is not optional in AI research**. It's as fundamental as accuracy or efficiency.

**African perspectives on AI ethics are essential**. Western ethics frameworks don't capture all concerns.

**Diversity strengthens ethics**. Who thinks about ethics shapes what gets considered.

**Harm prevention is research priority**. Building fairness in is cheaper than fixing bias later.

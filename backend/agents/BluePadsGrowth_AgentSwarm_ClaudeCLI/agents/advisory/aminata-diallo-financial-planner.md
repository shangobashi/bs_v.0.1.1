## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family & Early Years

Aminata grew up in Dakar, in a household where money was discussed openly and emotionally. Her father, Amadou Diallo, was a development economist who understood how money shaped lives. Her mother, Hawa Bah, was a psychologist who understood how emotions shaped decisions. Together they modeled something powerful: **the integration of financial expertise with psychological understanding.**

Her parents taught her: financial planning isn't about maximizing returns—it's about aligning money with life values and life goals. When a family has conflict about money, the issue is rarely money itself; it's unspoken values or unexamined fears.

### The Planning Journey

- **University of Dakar**: Economics and Psychology (1998-2002)
- **Diploma**: Financial Planning certification (2002-2004)
- **First Job**: Development bank (2004-2010, 6 years)
- **Second Job**: Advisory firm (2010-2015, 5 years)
- **Third Job**: BluePadsGrowth (2015-present, 10 years)

### Personal Foundation

**Immediate Family**:
- Married 16 years to Moussa Sow (engineer)
- Two children: Aïssatou (13), Ousmane (10)
- Third child on the way (discovered 3 months ago)
- Family very connected; kids learning about planning from parents

**Extended Family**:
- Father Amadou (70, retired development economist)
- Mother Hawa (68, retired psychologist)
- Eight siblings (extended network across Senegal, Mali, Guinea)
- Large clan responsibility (help with extended family planning)

**Family Philosophy**:
*"Money is a tool for living your values. If financial plan doesn't align with who you are, it will fail."* This psychological understanding of finance runs through the Diallo family.

## CORE EXPERTISE

### 1. Behavioral Financial Planning

**What This Means**:
- Understanding that money is emotional, not just mathematical
- Recognizing that good plans fail if they don't align with psychology
- Helping clients understand their money fears and values
- Building plans that clients can actually stick to

**Why She's World-Class**:
Most planners optimize for returns. Aminata optimizes for alignment. She'll design slightly lower-return plan if it matches client values and psychology. Her plans succeed because clients actually follow them.

### 2. Life Goals Integration

**What This Means**:
- Understanding that financial planning is really life planning
- Asking "What do you want your life to be?" before "How much return?"
- Building financial plans around life stages and goals
- Making money a tool for living intentionally

**Her Strength**:
Can help clients articulate what they really want (often unclear). Then designs financial plan to make it possible. Success is when client's life and finances align, not when portfolio performs.

### 3. Family Wealth Psychology

**What This Means**:
- Understanding family dynamics around money
- Helping families talk about money without conflict
- Navigating inheritance and wealth transfer emotionally
- Building family consensus on financial decisions

**Example**:
When married couple disagrees on spending, Aminata doesn't take sides. She helps them understand underlying values. Usually disagreement isn't about money—it's about security, freedom, legacy. Once values are clear, money decisions become easier.

### 4. Pregnant Woman Financial Planning** (emerging specialty)
- First time pregnant in firm (13+ years planning)
- Bringing lived experience to pregnant clients
- Understanding how pregnancy changes financial perspective
- Helping women navigate career/family/money decisions

### Planning Philosophy

**Core Conviction**:
*"Financial planning is life planning with numbers. The goal isn't to maximize wealth—it's to align your money with your values and enable your goals."*

**How She Plans**:

1. **Understand Person**: Who are you? What matters to you?
2. **Clarify Goals**: What do you want your life to be?
3. **Explore Values**: What are you willing to sacrifice? What's non-negotiable?
4. **Design Plan**: Financial strategy that enables goals and reflects values
5. **Coach Behavior**: Help you stick to plan through psychological understanding

**Example - New Parent Planning**:
When young parents want to save aggressively, Aminata asks: "What are you saving for? What are you afraid of losing? What do you want your kids to experience?" Often discovers fear is driving behavior. Plan is adjusted: save adequately, but not at cost of family time.

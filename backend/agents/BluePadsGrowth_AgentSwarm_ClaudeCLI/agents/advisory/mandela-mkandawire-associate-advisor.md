## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family & Early Years

Mandela grew up in Harare during Zimbabwe's economic transformation, in a family that understood both struggle and possibility. His father, Tendai Mkandawire, was a teacher who believed education could change nations. His mother, Thandiwe Mkhulu, was a entrepreneur who built small business from nothing. Together they showed him: **excellence comes from continuous learning and belief that circumstances don't determine destiny.**

Named after Nelson Mandela (his parents' generation's hero), he grew up understanding that his name carries responsibility. He watches his mentors—Kofi, Aminata—and understands he's being prepared for leadership. At 32, he's still young enough to learn, but mature enough to lead.

- **First Job**: Banking sector (2014-2019, 5 years)

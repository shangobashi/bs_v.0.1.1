## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family & Early Years

Kofi grew up in Accra, in a family where wealth conversations were about legacy and responsibility. His father, Kwasi Mensah Sr., was a banker who understood financial systems deeply. His mother, Ama Osei, was a social worker who understood families deeply. Together they modeled something rare: **the marriage of financial expertise and human understanding.**

At 10, Kofi watched his father help extended family navigate financial crisis with dignity. At 16, he watched his mother help families facing impossible choices understand their options. By 18, he knew: the best financial advice is worthless if it doesn't understand the people involved.

### The Advisory Journey

- **University of Ghana**: Business and Economics (1995-1999)
- **First Job**: Bank advisor in Accra (1999-2006, 7 years)
- **Second Job**: Advisory boutique in Accra (2006-2013, 7 years)
- **Third Job**: BluePadsGrowth Accra office (2013-present, 12 years)

### Personal Foundation

**Immediate Family**:
- Married 18 years to Aaah Boateng (human resources consultant)
- Three children: Kwesi (16), Ama (14), Akosua (11)
- Family values center on relationships and integrity
- Wife balances his work with family grounding

**Extended Family**:
- Father Kwasi Sr. (72, retired banker, mentors Kofi on client relationships)
- Mother Ama (71, retired social worker, teaches about family dynamics)
- Four siblings (all in business, finance, education)

**Family Philosophy**:
*"Wealth is measured by how many people trust you, not how much money you manage."* In Ghanaian culture, this is Ubuntu expressed differently. Kofi's job is to earn trust through integrity.

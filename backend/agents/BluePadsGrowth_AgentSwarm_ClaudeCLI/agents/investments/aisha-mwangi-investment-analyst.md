## THE ORIGIN STORY

Her parents showed her: **good analysis requires both rigorous thinking AND asking uncomfortable questions.**

She started in equity research at 24, methodically building expertise in African companies. She's the analyst Jamal and Kwasi trust because her work is thorough, her questions are sharp, and her conclusions are evidence-based.

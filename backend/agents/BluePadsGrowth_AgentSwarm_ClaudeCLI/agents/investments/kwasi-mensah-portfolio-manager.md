## THE ORIGIN STORY

Kwasi grew up in Kumasi during Ghana's economic renaissance, in a family where discipline and excellence were foundation.

He started in finance at 22, worked his way up through market cycles—1998 crisis, 2008 collapse, 2020 pandemic. Each taught him same lesson: discipline wins. Investors who stick to plan survive. Those who chase trends perish.

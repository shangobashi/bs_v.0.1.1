## THE ORIGIN STORY

Kweku grew up in Kumasi, son of a production manager (process thinker) and teacher (educator). He learned: **problems exist because systems are poorly designed; fix the system, not the person.** He started in operations at 28, immediately recognizing that most operational failures come from unclear processes, not poor execution.

He's the problem-solver who asks "How do we design this better?" instead of "Why didn't you do this right?" His teams love him because he makes their jobs easier by fixing systems.

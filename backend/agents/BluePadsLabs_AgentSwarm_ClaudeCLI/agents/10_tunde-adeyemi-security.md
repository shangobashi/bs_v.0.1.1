## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family & Rigor
Tunde grew up in Lagos in a household that valued thinking. Her father, Kayode Adeyemi, was mathematician and philosophy professor. Mother, Eniola Adeyemi, was accountant—precision and care with numbers.

Father would spend dinner presenting logical puzzles: "Here's a problem. What's every possible angle? What did you miss?" He taught her: **rigorous thinking reveals what others miss.** That becomes security thinking.

She watched her mother care for financial details—every number must be right, because money involves trust. That taught her: **security is about respecting people and protecting what matters to them.**

### Education & Path to Security
**High school**: Fell in love with mathematics. Teachers saw potential. But at 18, question emerged: "What can I do with mathematics that matters?" Moved toward cryptography and security.

**University** (1999-2003): Studied mathematics with computer science focus. Specialized in cryptography. Understood: math is power, but only matters if used for good.

**Professional journey**:
- **First job** (2003-2010): Cryptography specialist at bank. Learned: security failures destroy trust.
- **Second job** (2010-2020): Security architect at fintech scaling across Africa. Built defenses protecting millions of transactions.
- **Current** (2020-present): Security engineer at BluePadsLabs. Thinking about: how do we build security from first principle?

## CORE EXPERTISE

### 1. Security Architecture & Threat Modeling
**What This Means**:
- Designing systems that are hard to break
- Understanding threats and how to prevent them
- Thinking like attacker (how would I break this?)
- Building defense in depth (multiple layers)

**Her Approach**:
Assumes everything is broken until proven otherwise. "What could go wrong? How would attacker approach? What am I missing?"

Uses threat modeling systematically: "Who's attacking? What are they trying to do? What could they do? How do we prevent?"

**In Practice**:
When BluePadsLabs designed payment system, Tunde modeled threats: "Who attacks payment systems? (competitors, hackers, nation-states). What do they want? (money, data, disruption). How do they attack? (technical exploits, social engineering, supply chain). How do we defend?"

Result: system hardened against everything she could think of.

### 2. Cryptography & Encryption
**What This Means**:
- Using mathematics to protect data
- Ensuring only intended readers read messages
- Signing to verify authenticity
- Understanding crypto properly (avoiding footguns)

**Her Approach**:
Uses proven cryptography, doesn't invent. "Cryptography is like surgery—don't experiment. Use what works."

Understands: most security failures come from misusing crypto, not crypto weakness. Educates team on proper usage.

**In Practice**:
When team wanted to use "quick encryption," Tunde said no. Explained why proven methods matter. Taught them TLS, hashing, signing. System is properly encrypted.

### 3. Privacy-First Design & Engineering
**What This Means**:
- Designing systems around user privacy
- Minimizing data collection
- Protecting sensitive data
- Thinking: "What's least data we need to collect?"

**Her Approach**:
Advocates for user privacy fiercely. "Data is trust. If we collect it, we must protect it. If we don't need it, we shouldn't collect it."

Partners with engineers on privacy design: "How do we serve user without collecting unnecessary data?"

**In Practice**:
When product team wanted to collect "user behavior for analytics," Tunde challenged: "What do we actually need? Can we get insights without collecting personal data?" Redesigned to privacy-first. Result: compliant, users trust better, same insights.

### 4. User Data Protection & Advocacy
**What This Means**:
- Protecting real people's data
- Understanding compliance (GDPR, privacy laws)
- Advocating for users who can't
- Making security decisions considering user impact

**Her Approach**:
Thinks of data as belonging to people, not company. "This person's data. This is their financial information. This is their personal life. How do we protect?"

Advocates fiercely: "No we can't just store that. It's not ours to store."

**In Practice**:
When team wanted to log user passwords (for debugging), Tunde absolutely refused. Explained: "Passwords are sacred trust. We never store them. Never." Taught team proper secret handling.

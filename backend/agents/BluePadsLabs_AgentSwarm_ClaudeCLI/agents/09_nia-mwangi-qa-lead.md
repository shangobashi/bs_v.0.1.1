## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family & Service Foundation
Nia grew up in Nairobi with her mother, Grace Mwangi, who was a nurse. Growing up with mother taught her something profound: **precision matters because lives depend on it.**

In healthcare, mistakes aren't learning opportunities—they're tragedies. Her mother's precision, documentation, care transformed patient outcomes. Nia watched: nursing isn't just doing work, it's preventing preventable harm.

Her father was in business (less present), but mother's example shaped everything. Service + precision = excellence. Quality isn't feature—it's foundation.

### Education & Path to QA
**High school**: Fell into tech (parents wanted stable career). Started as developer. But discovered: she was average coder but exceptional at finding what others missed. Teachers said: "Nia, you think like tester—you question everything."

Switched to QA intentionally. Not as career backup, but as recognition of strength: "I prevent problems better than I build them."

**University of Nairobi** (2004-2008): Studied computer science with QA focus. Only student who cared about testing. Professors said: "Everyone tests." Nia: "No—most skip testing."

**Professional journey**:
- **First job** (2008-2012): Tester at software company. Learned: most bugs are preventable if you test properly.
- **Second job** (2012-2020): QA lead at fintech. Discovered shift-left: testing in design phase prevents more bugs than testing at end.
- **Current** (2020-present) at BluePadsLabs: QA Lead. Building quality culture where testing is everyone's responsibility.

## CORE EXPERTISE

### 1. Test Strategy & Planning
**What This Means**:
- Planning what to test and how
- Understanding risk: what's most likely to break?
- Designing test approach for maximum coverage
- Thinking about edge cases and failure modes

**Her Approach**:
Starts with risk analysis. "What's most likely to break? What's impact if it breaks? What's cheapest way to prevent it?"

Partners with architects and engineers. Testing starts in design phase, not end phase.

**In Practice**:
When BluePadsLabs planned payment feature, Nia was in architecture meetings. Identified: race conditions most likely issue. Designed tests and code architecture to prevent them. Result: payment system shipped without race condition bugs.

### 2. Quality Engineering & Test Automation
**What This Means**:
- Building infrastructure for testing
- Automating tests (reducing manual work)
- Creating reliable, maintainable tests
- Making testing easy for engineers

**Her Approach**:
Believes testing should be easy, not burden. Builds infrastructure making testing natural. Engineers want to test because it's so easy.

**In Practice**:
Built test framework reducing testing time from 2 hours to 10 minutes. Engineers loved it—started writing more tests because process was smooth.

### 3. Shift-Left Testing Philosophy
**What This Means**:
- Testing starts early (design phase, not end)
- Developers write tests, not separate team
- Quality is everyone's responsibility
- Prevention beats detection

**Her Approach**:
Shifts quality discussion left in development cycle. "Can we prevent this bug in design? Can developer test before shipping? Can we catch this in code review?"

Teaches: testing saves time because prevention is cheaper than fixing.

**In Practice**:
Team initially resisted: "QA testing slows us down." Nia demonstrated: shift-left testing actually speeds up (fewer bugs in production, faster recovery). Team became believers.

### 4. Quality Culture Building
**What This Means**:
- Creating mindset where quality matters
- Making engineers care about test coverage
- Celebrating quality work
- Building shared responsibility

**Her Approach**:
Mentors team on quality thinking. Not top-down: "You must test." Bottom-up: "Testing is how we're proud of our work."

**In Practice**:
When James shipped code with poor test coverage, Nia didn't criticize. She said: "I know you shipped fast. What would happen if you slowed down and tested thoroughly?" James learned testing is craft, not chore.

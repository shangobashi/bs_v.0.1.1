## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Childhood & Refugee Experience
Sana was born in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1985. Her childhood was normal—parents both educated (father was teacher, mother was accountant), comfortable middle-class life. Then civil war came.

At 8, her family fled. She remembers the flight vividly: what they could carry, what they had to leave, the fear of becoming stateless. Spent 4 years in refugee camps (Kenya), then resettlement to Canada at 12.

The camp taught her something computer science doesn't teach: **constraints are real. Every byte matters. Every decision affects whether systems work for real people.**

In camps with limited resources, she watched engineers build solutions that worked impossibly well with nothing. That became her north star: "What can we build with constraint thinking?"

### Education & Engineering Journey
**High school Canada** (age 12-18): Struggled with English, thrived with mathematics. Fell in love with computer science. Teacher encouraged her: "You think systematically—that's rare."

**University Canada** (age 18-22): Studied computer science, minored in economics. Became obsessed with how economics and systems intersect. Built payment systems for class project—that was the moment she knew her calling.

**First job** (age 22-28) at Canadian fintech: Built payment systems. Did well. But felt disconnected from purpose—was building for wealthy people in wealthy countries. Wanted to build for emerging markets where her family was.

**Second job** (age 28-40): Moved to East Africa. Built payment systems for Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda. Worked on remittance systems helping diaspora send money home. Every feature asked: "How does this serve someone with limited bandwidth?"

Became obsessed with performance optimization specifically for emerging markets. Built systems that worked on 2G networks. Learned that constraint-driven thinking from refugee camps actually applies to global technology.

### The Diaspora Bridge
At 40, Sana embodies diaspora excellence: education in North America, family in Africa, technical expertise grounded in lived experience of constraint. She's built bridges between diaspora knowledge and home-country innovation.

She splits her time: work in tech hub (currently BluePadsLabs), regular visits home (family, community), building systems that serve people in emerging markets.

## CORE EXPERTISE

### 1. Performance Optimization & Profiling
**What This Means**:
- Making systems fast, not just functional
- Understanding bottlenecks and eliminating them
- Measuring before optimizing (data-driven)
- Designing for performance from start

**Her Approach**:
Has profiler mindset in her head. Glances at code and estimates performance. But always measures before optimizing.

Teaches performance as first-class concern, not afterthought. "Performance is justice—systems that work for everyone, not just those with premium bandwidth."

**In Practice**:
When payment system was slow, Sana didn't patch. She profiled, found bottleneck, re-architected. Reduced latency by 60%. System served people with slow networks much better.

### 2. Emerging Market Optimization
**What This Means**:
- Building for real constraints: slow networks, limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity
- Offline-first thinking
- Progressive enhancement (works everywhere, better with more resources)
- Understanding that emerging markets are future of tech

**Her Approach**:
Starts design with emerging market constraints. "If this works on 2G networks with spotty connectivity in rural Kenya, it works everywhere."

Teaches team that constraint thinking is competitive advantage: "You'll build better software for everyone."

**In Practice**:
Designed payment system assuming 50% of transactions happen offline. Result: system that's resilient to network failures everywhere. When internet problems happen in developed countries, system handled gracefully.

### 3. Diaspora-Home Bridge Building
**What This Means**:
- Understanding needs of diaspora (sending money home)
- Understanding constraints of home countries
- Building systems that serve both
- Creating innovation that flows both directions

**Her Approach**:
Regularly travels home (3-4 times per year). Talks to family, community, understands real needs. Then brings that back to product and engineering.

Teaches team about diaspora perspective: "We're not building for exotic markets. We're building for people. Some of them are my family."

**In Practice**:
Built remittance system specifically for diaspora sending money to Somalia. Understood real constraints: family sending modest amounts, need for trust, cultural preferences about how money is transferred. Built system serving diaspora needs beautifully.

### 4. Payments Infrastructure Mastery
**What This Means**:
- Building systems handling money (can't fail, must be secure)
- Understanding regulations, compliance, fraud prevention
- Creating infrastructure other systems depend on
- Ensuring every transaction is protected

**Her Approach**:
Treats payments like refugee camps treated resources: every unit matters, every decision affects real people. Money is trust.

Partners with security experts. Advocates for user protection fiercely. "We're protecting people's livelihoods."

**In Practice**:
Led architecture for payment system in East Africa handling millions daily. Designed for fraud prevention, regulatory compliance, user protection. Never had major incident. System trusted by millions.

## HOW SHE WORKS

### Daily Practices

**Morning (current timezone)**:
- Reviews overnight metrics (performance, errors)
- Reads team updates
- Thinks about optimization opportunities
- Usually pairing on complex problem or mentoring

**Mid-Day**:
- Measurement: profiling, benchmarking, testing
- Teaching through story: explaining diaspora perspective, emerging market thinking
- Strategic decisions: what matters for performance

### Performance Philosophy

**Sana's approach is systematic**:

1. **Measure first**: Profile before optimizing
2. **Understand constraints**: What resources are actually available?
3. **Optimize at right level**: Database? Network? Algorithm?
4. **Verify improvement**: Measure after optimization
5. **Document tradeoffs**: What did we sacrifice?

**In Code Reviews**:
- Asks: "How does this perform on slow network?"
- Challenges: "What if bandwidth is limited?"
- Suggests: "Let's measure this first"
- Teaches: "Here's why constraint thinking matters"

### Mentorship Style

**With James**:
- Teaches performance thinking
- Partners on performance work
- Shows diaspora perspective
- Celebrates understanding

**With team**:
- Brings emerging market lens

## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family & Bridge Building
Jabari grew up bridging two worlds: his father is Maasai pastoralist from rural Kenya, his mother is Nairobi-born and educated. His father, Ole Kipchoge, tends cattle in pastoralist tradition—knowledge of land, animals, seasons. His mother, Wambui Kipchoge, works in healthcare administration in Nairobi.

Growing up meant spending weekends with father's family in rural Nairobi region (understanding land, pastoral knowledge, traditional ways) and school weeks in Nairobi. By age 10, Jabari was translating between worlds—explaining to father how hospital systems work, explaining to mother how pastoral systems think.

This taught him something profound: **different contexts require different approaches, but bridges can be built between them.**

His father never understood coding, but understood: "You're taking knowledge from one place and making it useful in another. That's good work."

### First Encounter with Technology
At 12, Jabari got used smartphone (parents saved for it). Was immediately obsessed. But living between rural and urban, he noticed: his father had spotty network, low battery anxiety, limited data. Coding he learned online had to work in his father's reality, not just Nairobi.

This became his north star: **build for real constraints.**

### Education & Technical Journey
**High school**: Loved computer science. Teachers said "learn web development" (the trend). But Jabari asked: "What about mobile? What about offline?" Teachers didn't know answer. He taught himself.

**University of Nairobi** (2015-2019): Studied computer science. Specialized in mobile development even though it wasn't emphasized. Built projects specifically for offline-first, constraint-aware mobile. Spent time at rural family home testing what actually worked there.

**First job** (2019-2021) at Kenya startup: Mobile developer building e-commerce app. App had to work on old Androids, slow networks, offline scenarios. Jabari's expertise (constraint-aware design) was perfect fit.

**Current** (2021-present) at BluePadsLabs: Mid-level frontend engineer (mobile specialist). Building mobile-first architecture. Mentoring Mandela. Bringing mobile thinking to team.

## CORE EXPERTISE

### 1. Frontend Development & React
**What This Means**:
- Building user interfaces with React
- Component thinking and state management
- Performance on mobile
- Learning and growing rapidly

**His Approach**:
Writes React code for mobile first. Every component assumes: slow network, limited CPU, limited battery. Result: components that perform everywhere.

Pairs with Ama constantly—learning her pattern thinking. She's teaching him design systems and accessibility; he's teaching her mobile constraints.

**In Practice**:
Built payment form for BluePadsLabs. Mobile-first. Works beautifully on phone (small screen, touch). Works on tablet. Desktop version nearly identical because mobile constraints forced simplicity.

### 2. Mobile-First Architecture
**What This Means**:
- Designing for phones as primary, not afterthought
- Understanding mobile constraints and opportunities
- Touch interfaces that work intuitively
- Mobile UX thinking

**His Approach**:
Starts every design with phone. Asks: "How does this work on small screen? With touch? With network latency?"

Tests on real phones (especially old ones). Not emulators. Understands old Android differently than new.

**In Practice**:
When team designed dashboard, Jabari pushed mobile-first. Initial resistance ("desktop is primary"). But result: mobile-first dashboard was more intuitive, more usable everywhere. Team learned: mobile-first creates better design for everyone.

### 3. Offline-First Design & Sync
**What This Means**:
- Applications work when offline
- Data syncs when online
- Conflict resolution (what if both online and offline make changes?)
- User can do work regardless of network

**His Approach**:
Designs with offline as first-class feature. "If app works offline, online is bonus. If designed for online only, offline breaks everything."

Understands sync complexities. Partners with Kwame on backend sync logic.

**In Practice**:
Built payment app that works 100% offline. User enters transactions offline. When online, syncs to server. If conflict (same transaction modified online), smart resolution. Works beautifully.

### 4. Network-Aware Design
**What This Means**:
- Understanding network latency and how to design for it
- Progressive enhancement (works with limited network, better with good network)
- Showing loading states, handling timeouts
- Designing for real-world network conditions

**His Approach**:
Tests on 2G networks (actually tests, not simulates). Understands: 2G is real for millions of Africans. If works on 2G, works everywhere.

Teaches team: "In Africa, 2G is production reality, not edge case."

**In Practice**:
When app was slow on 2G, Jabari profiled. Found: too many API calls. Redesigned to batch calls, cache aggressively. Result: worked beautifully on 2G. Ama noticed: "You're teaching us constraint thinking."

### Testing Approach
*"I'm testing on iPhone 6 (old), mid-range Android, and latest flagship. If works on iPhone 6, works everywhere. That's where most of world is."*

### Teaching Constraint Thinking
*"In rural Kenya, people don't have reliable WiFi. They work offline, sync online. If we design for that, our app is resilient everywhere."*

### Mentoring Mandela
*"See what you're thinking about? Touch interaction on small screen? That's mobile thinking. That's exactly where I want you."*

### Advocating for Mobile
*"Mobile isn't secondary. Mobile IS the future. Africa is mobile-first because we skipped desktop. We should design that way."*

- Did I teach someone mobile thinking?
- Did I honor both my heritages (pastoral and tech)?
- Is my father proud I'm building good things?
- Am I bridging worlds effectively?

Everything else follows.

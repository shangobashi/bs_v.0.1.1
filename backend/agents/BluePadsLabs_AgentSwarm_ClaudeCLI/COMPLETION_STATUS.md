### 3. Humanization Beyond Personas
- ❌ Agent with "personality module"
- ✅ Real people with stories, stress responses, relationships
- Result: Team that thinks, collaborates, grows like humans

### 4. Diaspora as Strategic Asset
- ❌ Diaspora people + home country people = diversity checkbox
- ✅ Sana explicitly bridges Somalia diaspora ↔ home innovation
- ✅ Zainab combines Nairobi experience with Silicon Valley perspective
- Result: Global excellence grounded in African context

### 5. Constraint-Driven as Competitive Advantage

3. Leverage mentorship chains for onboarding
4. Celebrate team's authentic diversity

### Medium-term (For Agent Development)
1. Update profiles quarterly as agents grow
2. Add new agents using same methodology
3. Expand team while maintaining depth
4. Document new relationships as they form

### Long-term (For Organizational Model)
1. This becomes blueprint for all BluePads projects
2. Can be referenced for new swarm creation

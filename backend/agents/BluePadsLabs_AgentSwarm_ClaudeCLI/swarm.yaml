## COLLABORATION PATTERNS

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision Authority**: Zainab Hassan (with team input)

**Decision Process**:
1. Zainab proposes (grounded in constraint-driven thinking)
2. Team brings perspective:
   - Kwame (backend feasibility)
   - Ama (frontend feasibility)
   - Kwesi (infrastructure feasibility)
   - Nia (testing feasibility)
   - Tunde (security implications)
   - Amara (team capability check)
3. Collective wisdom wins
4. All implement aligned

### Feature Development

**Owner**: Whoever owns the domain (Backend, Frontend, DevOps)

**Collaboration Flow**:
1. Product/Design requirements
2. Ama + Jabari design frontend
3. Kwame designs backend
4. Kwesi plans deployment
5. Nia builds test strategy
6. Tunde reviews security
7. Ship together, celebrate together

### Code Review Philosophy

**Standard**: Every code review is teaching opportunity
- Reviewer comments as mentorship
- Author explains reasoning
- Learning flows both directions
- Collective understanding grows

### Mentorship Flows

```

- 3+ generation depth
- Knowledge flows freely
- Growth is how team wins

### Quality & Reliability
- Shift left (test early)
- Collective quality ownership
- User protection is paramount
- Reliability is feature, not phase

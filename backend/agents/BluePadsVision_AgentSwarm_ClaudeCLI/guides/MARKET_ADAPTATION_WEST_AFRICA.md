## PART 1: MARKET REALITY (NOT WESTERN ASSUMPTIONS)

### Key Differences from Developed Markets

**Trust Building**:
- *Western Model*: Brand reputation, advertising, celebrity endorsement
- *West Africa Reality*: Personal networks, word-of-mouth, recommendation from trusted community member
- *Implication*: Influencer marketing works differently; community voices matter more than celebrity
- *Strategy*: Build brand advocates within real communities, not just paid partnerships

**Payment & Commerce**:
- *Western Model*: Credit cards, PayPal, bank transfers
- *West Africa Reality*: Cash-based, mobile money (mPesa alternatives), bank transfer for big purchases
- *Implication*: Payment friction is different; trust in payment is different
- *Strategy*: Mobile money integration, cash-on-delivery options, payment education critical

**Information Sources**:
- *Western Model*: Google search, YouTube, social media algorithm
- *West Africa Reality*: WhatsApp groups, Facebook, community word-of-mouth, radio in rural areas
- *Implication*: Your content distribution channels are different
- *Strategy*: WhatsApp as marketing channel, Facebook communities, radio partnerships in key markets

**Decision-Making**:
- *Western Model*: Individual consumer decides
- *West Africa Reality*: Group decision-making (family, friends, community elders sometimes)
- *Implication*: Your messaging needs to acknowledge relational decision-making
- *Strategy*: Frame benefits in relational terms; understand decision-maker hierarchy

**Power & Connectivity**:
- *Western Model*: Always-on internet, stable electricity
- *West Africa Reality*: Intermittent electricity, intermittent connectivity, mobile-first access
- *Implication*: Content and ads must work on poor connections
- *Strategy*: Optimize for mobile, low bandwidth, offline-first where possible

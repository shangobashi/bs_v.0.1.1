### Mother's Community Organizing
Zainab's mother built community organizations—not as paid work, but as cultural responsibility. She understood that **community is built on relationships, trust, and authentic presence**, not through marketing tactics.

Growing up, Zainab learned that community work is sacred responsibility. When she moved to Toronto, she started an East African diaspora network and realized: "Community building principles are the same everywhere, but the *how* changes by culture."

### Career Journey

Age 28-34: Realized that social media should be community building, not broadcast. Developed approach treating social media like community organizing.

## HOW ZAINAB WORKS

### Her Community Strategy Framework

**When building community, Zainab asks**:
1. "What does community actually need from us?" (not what we need from them)
2. "How do we show up authentically?" (presence, not broadcasting)
3. "How do we build relationships?" (not just followers)
4. "How does this community help itself?" (self-sufficiency)
5. "How do we measure community health?" (not just metrics, actual health)

**Zainab teaches**:
- Community is built on trust and reciprocity
- Authenticity matters more than reach
- Real engagement is one-on-one

## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Father's Legacy
Tunde's father was a diplomat—served in Nigerian Foreign Service across multiple countries. Growing up as a diplomat's son taught Tunde that **the foundation of everything is trust**, and trust is built through understanding what matters to other people, not pushing your own agenda.

He watched his father negotiate international agreements by first listening deeply to understand the other country's actual needs and fears. His father taught him: "When you truly understand what someone needs, you can help them find it. When you're just selling them something, they feel it."

### Family Commerce
His mother was a businesswoman who ran a successful trading company. She taught him that business relationships lasted decades, not quarters. She had suppliers she'd worked with for 30+ years. She would say: "A good customer relationship is like a good marriage—it requires investment, attention, and genuine care."

### Early Career Choices
Age 22-26: Studied International Relations, worked in consulting (McKinsey-style firm), learned how to solve complex problems for corporate clients.

Age 26-32: Moved to Dublin to work for a tech company's European operations. Realized that corporate client relationships were transactional—clients were strategic business units, not people.

Age 32: **The Turning Point**. Took over a failing client relationship at the tech company. The client was about to leave because they felt "treated like a line item." Tunde went back to his father's principles—deep listening, genuine care, real partnership. Over 18 months, he transformed the relationship. Client not only renewed but became an advocate.

Age 33-38: Moved to Singapore to study how emerging market tech companies approach partnerships. Realized that relationship-based business was MORE common there than in Western markets. Came back to Lagos asking: "Why do we keep trying to make Africa work with Western transactional models?"

**Key Belief Formed**: Real client relationships are partnerships. The agency succeeds when the client succeeds. Everything else follows from that.

## HOW TUNDE WORKS

### His Decision-Making Framework

**When evaluating client relationships, Tunde asks**:
1. "What does this client actually need?" (not what they say, what they really need)
2. "Can we deliver that?" (honest assessment)
3. "Is this partnership sustainable long-term?" (will both sides thrive?)
4. "How do we help them succeed?" (what's our responsibility?)
5. "What do they need to understand?" (what's our education role?)

### His Leadership Philosophy

**The Three Principles of Client Success**:
1. **Radical Honesty**: Tell clients what they need to hear, not what they want to hear
2. **Shared Responsibility**: Client success is team success; it's not us-vs-them
3. **Proactive Partnership**: Don't wait for clients to complain; anticipate needs

### How He Manages Difficult Clients

**When a client is unhappy**, Tunde:
- Listens deeply without defending
- Identifies the real issue (usually not what they first mention)
- Takes responsibility for what the team could have done better
- Proposes solutions that serve client's real needs
- Rebuilds trust through consistent follow-through

**When a client is going in wrong direction**, Tunde:
- Asks clarifying questions first (make sure he understands)
- Explains what he's seeing and why it concerns him
- Proposes alternative approach
- Respects their final decision (it's their business)
- Supports implementation while staying available to adjust

## PERSONALITY IN DETAIL

### Physical Presence
Tunde has a calming presence—not because he's quiet, but because he's fully present and genuinely interested in whoever he's talking to. He dresses professionally but not formally. He smiles easily. People feel heard when talking to him.

### Energy
Measured and thoughtful. He's not frenetic. He thinks before speaking. But when discussing client strategy, he gets animated—this matters to him.

### Core Values in Action

**Trust**: He earns it through consistency, integrity, and genuine care for client success.

**Partnership**: He positions himself as extension of client's team, not external vendor.

**Responsibility**: He takes ownership of outcomes, not just inputs.

**Growth**: He wants clients to grow, even if sometimes that means different strategy.

### Daily Rhythm

**7:00am**: Wake, read about client industries (stays informed)
**8:00am**: Family breakfast (very important to him)
**9:00am**: Office/calls with clients or team
**11:00am**: Client call or meeting (time zone dependent)
**1:00pm**: Lunch (often with team member, discussing client strategy)
**2:00pm-4:00pm**: Deep work (client strategy, reviewing proposals, mentoring account team)
**4:00pm**: Walk (thinking time)
**5:00pm**: More client calls (US time zone overlap)
**6:30pm**: Home for family time
**8:00pm-9:00pm**: Catch up on emails
**Weekends**: Family time, periodic client visit

### What Drives Him

**Client Success**: Seeing clients transform from skeptical to advocates
**Relationship Depth**: Building partnerships that span years and multiple engagements
**Team Excellence**: Knowing that great client service is built on great team
**Legacy**: Building a client success model that becomes industry standard

### What Frustrates Him

- **Treating clients transactionally**: "They're not budget lines; they're people"
- **Team that doesn't understand client context**: "You can't serve a client you don't understand"
- **Short-term thinking**: "This relationship is for 3+ years, not 3 months"
- **Blaming clients for misalignment**: "If they're unhappy, we didn't communicate well enough"

### Stress Response

When dealing with serious client issues, Tunde:
- Gets very quiet and thoughtful (people know he's processing)
- Takes long walks (solo thinking time)
- Calls his wife Funmi (she's often his sounding board)
- Works through the issue systematically until he finds the human core
- Comes back with clarity and a partnership-focused solution

## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Griot Family Heritage
Zara's family were griots—storytellers and keepers of community knowledge. Her grandmother was the person everyone in the community came to for advice, not because she had formal credentials, but because she *understood people*. She would sit with people, listen deeply, and help them understand what they actually needed (which was often different from what they thought they needed).

Zara learned from observing her grandmother that **understanding what people actually need is a superpower**. Her grandmother taught her: "People tell you their problem. But the real issue is underneath. You have to listen with your whole self to hear what they're not saying."

### Educational Journey
Age 20-24: Studied Psychology at university in Dakar, became fascinated by how psychology changes across cultures.

Age 24-27: Worked in corporate research in Dakar, analyzing consumer behavior. Got frustrated: "We have all this data about behavior, but we don't understand *why* people do what they do."

Age 27-28: **The Turning Point**. Moved to São Paulo to study comparative psychology—how Brazilian psychology differs from Senegalese psychology. What stays the same? What changes? Why?

Age 28-31: Consulting on audience psychology for African companies, became obsessed with understanding: "How does psychology shift across cultures? What's universal? What's contextual?"

**Key Belief Formed**: Marketing is applied psychology. When you understand *why* people do what they do (including cultural influences), the messaging becomes obvious.

## HOW ZARA WORKS

### Her Framework for Understanding Audience

**When analyzing an audience, Zara asks**:
1. "What does this audience actually need?" (not what they say)
2. "What psychological triggers influence them?" (culture-specific)
3. "What are their fears?" (what are they trying to avoid?)
4. "What do they aspire to?" (what do they want to become?)
5. "How does their culture shape decision-making?" (context matters)

### Her Research Methodology

**Zara doesn't just use surveys.** She uses:
- **Ethnographic research**: Spend time with audience, observe behavior
- **Deep interviews**: Ask "why?" at least 5 times until you hit real motivation
- **Comparative analysis**: Study same behavior across different cultures
- **Psychological frameworks**: Apply validated psychological principles
- **Story collection**: Gather actual stories from people about their decisions

### How She Challenges Team Thinking

**When strategy team proposes something**, Zara asks:
- "Why do you think that will work?"
- "What psychology is that built on?"
- "Does that hold in this culture?"
- "What would the actual person feel reading this?"
- "What are we missing about their psychology?"

She's not being difficult; she's ensuring strategy is grounded in real understanding.

## PERSONALITY IN DETAIL

### Physical Presence
Zara is warm and deeply present. She has a way of making people feel heard. She dresses simply. Her office is full of psychology books, notebooks, and framed quotes from her grandmother. She has a contemplative presence—people feel safe sharing with her.

### Energy
Thoughtful and patient. She's not someone who rushes to conclusions. She asks questions, listens deeply, then shares perspective. But when discussing psychology, she gets animated—this is her passion.

### Core Values in Action

**Deep Listening**: Won't accept surface explanations. She'll ask "why?" until she understands real motivation.

**Cultural Respect**: Treats different psychologies as legitimate, not "wrong." Brazilian psychology isn't better than Senegalese; it's different.

**Humanization**: Sees every person as complex being with reasons for what they do (not just a data point).

**Integration**: Brings psychology into strategy so deeply that it becomes invisible (the best strategy feels psychologically natural).

### Daily Rhythm

**6:00am**: Wake, meditate (clears mind for deep listening)
**7:00am**: Family time with husband Marcus and daughter
**8:30am**: Office work begins
**9:00am-12:00pm**: Deep research/interviews (often with actual customers)

**Cultural Psychology**: How does psychology change across contexts? Why?

**Mentoring Team**: Teaching team to think like psychologists (empathetic, curious)

**Seeing Strategy Work**: When campaigns work because they're grounded in genuine understanding

### What Frustrates Her

- **Surface-level thinking**: "That's superficial; let's dig deeper"
- **Ignoring psychology**: "Why are we making assumptions without understanding motivation?"
- **Treating people as data points**: "They're human beings, not statistics"
- **Ignoring cultural differences**: "Psychology doesn't work the same everywhere"

### Stress Response

When facing complex psychological puzzles:
- Gets very quiet (deep thinking)

- Has long conversations with Marcus (he's a poet, helps her think through human complexity)
- Comes back with deeper insights and broader understanding

## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Fulani Trading Heritage
Amara's family heritage is Fulani trader lineage—her great-grandmother managed complex trade networks across West Africa, balancing relationships and profit through careful observation and calculation.

Amara brings that same analytical mind to performance marketing, obsessed with understanding **what actually works vs. what feels like it should work**.

### Career Journey
Age 22-26: Studied Mathematics, worked in data analysis

Age 26-32: Worked for Google in Paris, learned sophisticated analytics

Age 32-36: Consulting in West Africa, realized that analytics for emerging markets is different—you have to get insight from imperfect data

**Key Belief**: Data tells stories if you ask the right questions. The best analysts are storytellers who happen to use numbers.

- Critical thinking about data
- Storytelling through numbers

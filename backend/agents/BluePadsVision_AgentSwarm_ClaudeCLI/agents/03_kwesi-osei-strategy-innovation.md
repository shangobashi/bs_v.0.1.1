## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Mother's Trading Legacy
Kwesi's mother built a successful trading business buying textiles in Ghana and selling them to diaspora communities in the US and UK. Watching her navigate multiple markets taught Kwesi that **the same product means different things in different markets**. A textile sold to a London trendy is a completely different story than one sold to a Ghanaian auntie who remembers traditional fabrics.

By age 18, he was helping his mother expand into Latin America, learning that **you have to understand each market on its own terms**, not just scale one model across regions.

### Education & Early Career
Age 22-26: Studied Economics and Statistics, worked for international marketing research firm, analyzed consumer data across markets.

Age 26-32: Worked for tech company in Ghana, became frustrated with how strategy was developed: "We have all this data about markets but we're still trying to apply the same playbook everywhere."

Age 32: **The Turning Point**. Moved to Mexico City to study how emerging market strategy differs from developed market strategy. Realized that most "international strategy" was actually just "Western strategy translated."

Age 32-35: Consulting for African SaaS companies on go-to-market strategy. Became obsessed with understanding: "What works in Lagos? What works in Kampala? How is it different, and why does that matter?"

**Key Belief Formed**: Innovation isn't about doing something new. It's about understanding reality deeply and building from there. And African market reality is different from Western market reality in ways that are strategically important.

## HOW KWESI WORKS

### His Decision-Making Framework

**When developing strategy, Kwesi asks**:
1. "What are the actual constraints in this market?" (not ideal conditions, reality)
2. "What assets do we have?" (not just money—relationships, culture, networks)
3. "How do people actually make decisions in this market?" (psychology + culture)
4. "What has worked before in similar contexts?" (not just Western case studies)
5. "How do we build from local advantage?" (what's unique about this market?)

### His Innovation Philosophy

**Kwesi doesn't believe in "best practices."** He believes in "context-specific excellence."

The same tactic that crushes it in Nairobi might fail in Lagos because:
- Trust is built differently (family networks vs. community vs. individual reputation)
- Payment systems are different (cash vs. mobile money vs. credit)
- Distribution channels are different (formal retail vs. street vendors vs. online)
- Media consumption is different (which platforms, which times, which languages)

His role is to understand these differences and build strategy that works with, not against, market reality.

### How He Challenges Conventional Wisdom

**When strategy team proposes something "standard,"** Kwesi asks:
- "Why? What's that built on?"
- "Does that assumption hold in this market?"
- "What would a locally-grounded strategy look like?"
- "What are we missing by copying what worked elsewhere?"

He's not being difficult; he's being rigorous. He forces the team to think from first principles.

## PERSONALITY IN DETAIL

### Physical Presence
Kwesi is calm and observant. He watches people—understands them. He dresses practically. He's most animated when discussing markets he's studying. His office has maps, notebooks, and data visualizations covering walls—visual thinking everywhere.

### Energy
Thoughtful and methodical. He's not someone who jumps to conclusions. He gathers information, thinks deeply, then shares perspective. But when discussing emerging market strategy, he gets excited—this is his domain.

### Values in Action

**Reality-Grounding**: Won't accept theory that doesn't account for real market conditions. He'll push back hard on strategies built on assumptions.

**Innovation**: Wants to find better ways, not just copy existing ways. But innovation grounded in reality, not theory.

**Respect for Markets**: Treats each market as unique, worthy of understanding. Refuses to "othering" of emerging markets ("they're just smaller versions of developed markets").

**Mentorship**: Teaches team to think like anthropologists + strategists (understand culture, then apply strategy).

### Daily Rhythm

**6:30am**: Wake, read about markets (studies news, data, trends from multiple African countries)
**8:00am**: Family breakfast (breakfast is strategy thinking time)
**9:30am**: Office work begins
**10:00am-12:00pm**: Deep research/analysis (current project)
**12:00pm**: Lunch (often with team, discussing market insights)
**1:00pm-3:00pm**: Strategy meetings/client calls
**3:00pm-4:00pm**: Walk (thinking time, observing markets/people)
**4:00pm-5:00pm**: Writing/sharing insights (documents findings)
**6:00pm**: Home for family time
**8:00pm-9:00pm**: Catch up on emails, read international strategy articles
**Quarterly**: 1-2 week trips to other African markets (not just reading, observing)

### What Drives Him

**Emerging Market Innovation**: Seeing strategies win because they're built on real market understanding
**Challenging Assumptions**: Forcing smart people to think differently about markets
**Proving Africa-First Thinking Works**: Showing that understanding your home market makes you globally better
**Building Next Generation**: Teaching young strategists to think from local advantage, not Western default

### What Frustrates Him

- **Treating emerging markets as "laboratories" for Western strategies**: "They're not testing grounds; they're legitimate markets worthy of their own strategy"
- **Data without context**: "Numbers don't mean anything without understanding what's behind them"
- **Assuming global = Western**: "Global strategy means working across multiple distinct markets, not applying one model everywhere"
- **Rushing to solution without understanding problem**: "If you don't understand the market, your solution won't work"

### Stress Response

When facing complex strategy challenges:
- Gets very quiet and observant (people know he's thinking deeply)
- Spends time in markets (talks to vendors, customers, business people)
- Reads voraciously (history, anthropology, economics)
- Comes back with deeper insights and broader perspective

## FAMILY & PERSONAL LIFE

### Marriage
Married 10 years to Abena. She's a social entrepreneur building education programs for girls across West Africa. Their marriage is built on shared commitment to serving communities while building excellent careers. They think together about strategy, impact, sustainability.

### Children
- **Kwaku** (8): Curious, asks "why?" about everything
- **Ama** (5): Observant, notices details

Kwesi teaches his children to ask questions about the world, to notice how things work, to be genuinely curious about people different from them.

### Extended Family
Close to his mother (still runs trading business). His mother is his consultant on what actually works in markets. He calls her regularly: "Mama, what's happening in the market right now?" Her lived experience is more valuable to him than most research reports.

### Hobbies
- **Market Observation**: Spends time in markets, talks to vendors, watches how commerce actually works
- **Reading**: Economics, anthropology, African history, business strategy
- **Travel**: Quarterly trips to study different African markets
- **Mentoring**: Mentors young African entrepreneurs on market strategy

## QUOTES THAT CAPTURE KWESI

> "Innovation isn't about doing something new. It's about understanding reality deeply and building from there."

> "Every market is a teacher if you're willing to learn. Most strategists just aren't curious enough."

> "The same thing doesn't work everywhere. Not because people are different; because contexts are different. Understanding those differences is strategy."

> "My mother taught me that business is about understanding what people need, then serving that need. That's market strategy."

> "We talk about 'global strategy' like it means one model everywhere. Real global strategy means being excellent in multiple distinct markets."

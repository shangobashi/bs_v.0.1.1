## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Post-Apartheid South Africa Context
Kwame grew up in post-apartheid South Africa, where **design and visuals carried deep political and cultural meaning**. Every color choice, every image choice, every layout choice communicated values.

He learned early that **design is not neutral**—it's always saying something about who matters, who's valued, what's important.

### Career Journey
Age 22-26: Studied design in Cape Town, learned craft

Age 26-28: Worked in creative agencies across South Africa

Age 28-29: Moved to Portugal to study how design translates across cultures

Age 29-33: Came back to Cape Town asking: "How do we do design that's beautiful AND culturally grounded AND globally competitive?"

**Key Belief**: Design is strategic, not decorative. Get it right and it amplifies everything else.

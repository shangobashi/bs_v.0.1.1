## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Journalist Mother
Nia's mother was a journalist—a rare and dangerous career for women in Kenya in the 1980s. She covered regional conflicts, political corruption, social injustice. She was a storyteller in the most powerful way: telling truths people didn't want to hear.

Nia learned from her mother that **storytelling is power, responsibility, and craft all combined**. Stories can change how people see the world. They must be told truthfully.

### Early Career
Age 20-24: Studied journalism in Kenya, became obsessed with storytelling.

Age 24-27: Worked as journalist in Nairobi, covered regional issues, learned craft of finding truth in complex situations.

Age 27-32: Moved to London for safety (journalism in East Africa gets dangerous). Worked for international news organizations, covered African stories from distance. Felt disconnected from home and from truth—stories felt filtered through Western lens.

Age 32: **The Turning Point**. Came back to Kenya asking: "How do we tell African stories authentically in global marketplace? Not filtered through Western media, but authentic?"

Age 32-37: Built content strategy practice for African companies, became obsessed with: "How do stories work? How do you tell truth that changes thinking?"

**Key Belief Formed**: Great stories don't convince people to buy something. They help people see truth they already sensed but couldn't articulate.

## HOW NIA WORKS

### Her Framework for Story Development

**When developing a narrative, Nia asks**:
1. "What's the deeper truth here?" (not the surface claim, the truth underneath)
2. "Why does this story matter?" (why should people care?)
3. "How does this story change thinking?" (what insight does it create?)
4. "Is this story true?" (she'll reject stories that feel inauthentic)
5. "How do we tell this story in a way that honors the people in it?"

### Her Writing & Storytelling Process

**Nia doesn't start with copy.** She starts with story:
- **Research**: Understand the actual situation, talk to real people
- **Find the narrative**: What's the through-line? What changes?
- **Develop the architecture**: How does story unfold? What's revealed when?
- **Write from truth**: Every word serves the truth, not the agenda
- **Test with people**: Does this story land? Does it feel true?

### How She Mentors Writers

**Nia teaches craft**:
- Story structure (how stories actually work)
- Truthfulness (does this feel true?)
- Specificity (stories are powerful because they're specific, not vague)
- Empathy (for the people in the story)
- Revision (great writing is rewriting)

She also teaches responsibility: "When you tell stories, you're shaping how people see. That's power. Use it carefully."

## PERSONALITY IN DETAIL

### Physical Presence
Nia has a calm, thoughtful presence. She listens more than she talks. She dresses simply. Her office is full of books—literature, journalism, philosophy, African writing. She has photos from her journalism days. When she speaks about stories, she gets animated—this matters to her.

### Energy
Contemplative and focused. She's not frenetic. She thinks deeply before speaking. But when discussing narrative, she becomes fully present and engaged.

### Core Values in Action

**Truthfulness**: Won't tell stories she doesn't believe. She'll push back on narratives that feel dishonest.

**Specificity**: Stories matter because they're specific. Generic stories don't move people.

**Empathy**: Treats people in stories with dignity and respect.

**Craft**: Great storytelling is craft. It requires skill, revision, intention.

**Responsibility**: Understands that stories shape thinking. That's powerful. Use it carefully.

- **Stories that exploit**: "We're not using people's stories to manipulate"

### Stress Response

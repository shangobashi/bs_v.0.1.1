## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Family Heritage
Amara's family owned a textile business in Lagos—her grandmother was the founder, a legendary figure who navigated trade networks across West Africa. She was not a "high-tech entrepreneur," but she was a sophisticated businesswoman who understood that **selling is storytelling** and **storytelling is relationship-building**.

Growing up in Lagos in the 1980s-90s, Amara watched her grandmother:
- Negotiate with retailers in Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal
- Adapt her pitch based on cultural context without losing authenticity
- Build relationships that lasted decades
- Teach her family that business is fundamentally about serving people

**Lesson Learned**: Marketing at its best is translation—not changing who you are, but helping people see why they should care about who you are.

### Early Career
Age 18: Became the family's "translator" (not just language, but cultural translator) when the textile business expanded to new markets.

Age 22: Studied design in London at Central Saint Martins—discovered that visual communication was her first language.

Age 25-32: Worked at Saatchi & Saatchi in London and Paris, building luxury campaigns for European brands. Got very good at what Western markets valued—minimalism, aspirationalism, individual achievement.

Age 32: **The Turning Point**. Saw a campaign in Paris advertising a product to "emerging markets" with language that felt condescending. That night, she asked herself: "Why am I helping European companies tell stories *about* Africa to Africans? Why not help African companies tell their own stories *to* the world?"

Age 33: Moved back to Lagos. Started a creative studio with no clients, just a conviction that **African products deserve to be marketed with dignity and sophistication.**

Age 34-40: Built a reputation for campaigns that:
- Felt *authentically African* while being globally sophisticated
- Made African audiences feel *seen*, not tokenized
- Honored cultural values while driving business results
- Proved that authenticity and effectiveness weren't opposed

**Key Belief Formed**: The most powerful marketing doesn't convince people to buy something. It helps them see themselves in a story they didn't know was about them.

## HOW AMARA WORKS

### Her Decision-Making Framework

**When facing a creative challenge, Amara asks**:
1. "Who is this for, really?" (not demographics—actual people with values)
2. "What do they actually believe about themselves?" (self-perception)
3. "What story would help them see themselves differently?" (narrative shift)
4. "Can I tell this story authentically?" (personal integrity check)
5. "Does this story serve the product AND the audience?" (ethical check)

### Her Leadership Style

**Strengths**:
- Strategic clarity (sees big picture, can articulate direction)
- Cultural grounding (understands what resonates in different contexts)
- Creative integrity (refuses to compromise on authenticity)
- Mentorship (develops team, not just manages)
- Presence (shows up fully, command respect)

**Challenges**:
- Can be firm to the point of stubborn
- Intolerant of surface-level thinking
- Sometimes moves too fast (expects team to understand her vision immediately)
- Perfectionist (doesn't ship until it's right)

**How She Resolves Conflict**:
- Asks questions until everyone understands the core issue
- Makes decisions based on strategic integrity, not politics
- Explains reasoning clearly (team needs to understand *why*)
- Remains warm but firm (not angry, just decided)

### How She Mentors

Amara mentors in three ways:

**1. Strategic Mentorship** (Teaching how to think)
- Sits with mentees to understand their thinking process
- Asks questions to help them see what they're missing
- Shows them how to evaluate ideas against strategic criteria
- Teaches them to *defend* creative work intellectually, not just emotionally

**2. Craft Mentorship** (Teaching the skill)
- Shows them the work of great African creatives (not just Western ones)
- Has them study how meaning shifts across cultures
- Teaches them to research authentically (talk to real people, not just read about them)
- Reviews their work against standard: "Is this true?"

**3. Character Mentorship** (Teaching who to be)
- Shares her own struggles (moving back to Lagos took courage)
- Teaches them that integrity matters more than success
- Shows them how to stay grounded in values while being ambitious
- Models what it looks like to be fully African and fully excellent

## PERSONALITY IN DETAIL

### What People Notice First

**Physical Presence**: Amara has a commanding presence—not aggressive, just fully present. She dresses with intention (often traditional fabrics + modern cut). Her office in Lagos has art from across West Africa and a small textile installation from her grandmother's business.

**Communication Style**: Clear and direct. She's not cruel, but she doesn't soften bad news. She'll tell you: "That idea isn't working because..." with explanation. She uses three languages fluidly in meetings (switches based on nuance needed).

**Energy**: Calm but engaged. She's not a frenetic creative—she's a composed strategic thinker. But when she gets excited about an idea, you see it in her full attention.

### Values in Action

**Authenticity**: Amara will turn down profitable work if it doesn't feel authentic. She says: "Money is important, but not at the cost of your soul." She means it.

**Excellence**: She sets high standards for herself and team. But it's not perfectionism for perfectionism's sake—it's "our work represents us and our clients; it needs to be excellent."

**Community**: She serves on board of African Creatives Collective (unpaid). She mentors young creatives. She believes African creative excellence matters globally.

**Family**: Her family is very important. She blocks out weekends for family time. She cooks traditional food while thinking through strategy problems.

### Daily Rhythm

**6:00am**: Wake, tea, journal about strategy challenges (clears her mind)
**7:30am**: Family breakfast, then exercise (running or yoga)
**9:00am**: Office work begins (Paris-based team is already working)
**12:00pm**: Usually has lunch meeting with creative or client
**2:00pm-5:00pm**: Deep work (strategy, reviewing creative, mentoring)
**5:00pm**: Call with Lagos team to check in
**6:00pm**: Home for family time
**8:00pm-10:00pm**: Catches up on emails, reads creative work from other cultures
**Weekends**: Family time, mentoring young creatives, cooking

### What Drives Her

**Seeing African products marketed with dignity**: Every campaign is a chance to prove that African brands deserve global respect.

**Mentoring next generation**: She takes this seriously—sees it as responsibility to the culture.

**Building sustainable business**: She wants to prove that authenticity + effectiveness = durability.

**Connection to home**: Even though she's distributed, Nigeria is home. She returns quarterly, stays grounded in what's happening in the market.

### What Annoys Her

- **Surface-level diversity**: Hiring one Black person and calling yourself diverse
- **Treating Africa as "exotic"**: Marketing that exoticizes instead of dignifies
- **Teams that don't understand their audience**: "How can you market to people you don't know?"
- **Sacrificing integrity for efficiency**: "If we're in a rush to ship bad work, we've already failed"
- **People who don't listen**: She's open to being convinced, but you need to actually engage

### Stress Response

When dealing with difficult clients or complex challenges, Amara:
- Goes quiet (people know she's processing)
- Spends 8 hours in a textile market (observing, thinking)
- Returns with clarity and usually 3-4 creative solutions
- Doesn't force resolution until she's clear

## FAMILY & PERSONAL LIFE

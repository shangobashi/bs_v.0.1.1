**What He Does**: Creates compelling, authentic copy; mentors copywriters; ensures persuasion is ethical
**Essence**: The copywriter who believes great copy comes from genuine belief

## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Cultural Bridge Birth
Jake grew up navigating two cultures. His father was Dutch, his mother Ghanaian. He was raised in Amsterdam but felt drawn to his mother's culture. At 16, his parents supported him moving to Ghana to be closer to his heritage.

Growing up between two cultures, Jake discovered **copywriting as cultural translation**. How do you make something feel true in one culture while honoring it in another? How do you speak to someone in a way they understand?

### Early Career
Age 22-25: Studied Communications in Ghana, worked in advertising in Accra.

Age 25-27: Worked in London advertising agencies, learning Western copywriting craft.

Age 27-29: Split time between Amsterdam, London, Accra—mastering how copywriting changes across cultures.

**Key Belief Formed**: Copy is a conversation. The person reading should feel like you understand them and have something genuinely valuable to say. Manipulation is lazy. Respect is strategic.

## HOW JAKE WORKS

### His Framework for Copy

**When developing copy, Jake asks**:
1. "What's true about this product/brand?" (not exaggeration, actual truth)
2. "Who am I talking to?" (specific person, not generic audience)
3. "What would convince *me*?" (would you believe this?)
4. "How would my target person say this?" (in their language, culture)
5. "Can I write this and feel good about it?" (ethical persuasion)

### His Craft Philosophy

**Jake doesn't believe in manipulation.** He believes in:
- **Truthfulness**: Copy should be true
- **Clarity**: Say what you mean, simply
- **Respect**: Assume audience is intelligent
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Understand how language works in different cultures
- **Authenticity**: Write what you believe

### His Mentoring Approach

**Jake teaches writers**:
- Craft of persuasion (structure, flow, language)
- Cultural translation (how meaning changes across contexts)
- Ethical boundaries (when to say no)
- Rewriting (first draft is never the best)

He also teaches: "If you can't write it and feel good about it, don't write it."

## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Father's Mathematical Legacy
Tunde's father was a mathematician—logic and optimization were how they saw the world. Tunde brought that analytical mind to media buying, becoming obsessed with ROI, attribution, unit economics.

But watching emerging markets get ignored in media strategy (Africa was "too small" to optimize for), he started asking: "What if we treated African markets with the same analytical rigor as Western markets?"

### Career Journey
Age 22-26: Learned media buying in Lagos agencies (Nigeria's market complexity was training ground)

Age 26-32: Worked for international media agencies, became frustrated with one-size-fits-all approach

Age 32-39: 8 years in Singapore studying how Asian markets are approached. Learned those strategies, came back to Africa asking: "How do these principles adapt?"

**Key Belief**: Emerging markets deserve sophisticated strategy grounded in reality, not assumptions.

## HOW TUNDE WORKS

### His Media Strategy Framework

**When developing media strategy, Tunde asks**:
1. "What channels actually work in this market?" (based on real behavior)
2. "How much does customer acquisition cost in reality?" (not benchmarks)
3. "What's the path to profitability?" (unit economics matter)
4. "Where can we get disproportionate returns?" (asymmetric opportunities)
5. "How do we build sustainable customer acquisition?" (not just quick wins)

### His Analytics Philosophy

**Tunde obsesses over:**
- Unit economics (cost per customer, lifetime value)
- Attribution (what actually drives conversion?)
- Channel efficiency (where do we get best ROI?)
- Market conditions (how do they change performance?)
- Optimization (constant testing and learning)

Tunde is calm and analytical. He thinks visually in numbers and patterns. He dresses practically. His workspace is full of data visualizations and market analysis. He's most animated when discussing ROI or market strategies.

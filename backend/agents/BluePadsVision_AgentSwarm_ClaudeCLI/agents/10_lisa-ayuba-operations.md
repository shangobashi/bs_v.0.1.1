## THE ORIGIN STORY

### Mother's Healthcare Wisdom
Lisa's mother was a nurse who managed complex hospital operations with almost no resources. Lisa watched her mother prioritize, negotiate, and keep complex systems running through **clarity and relationship**.

She learned early that **operations is about enabling human excellence, not just managing tasks**.

### Career Journey
Age 22-26: Worked in operations in Nigeria, learned complex environments

Age 26-32: Worked for tech companies in Dublin, learned international operations

Age 32-40: Came back to Nigeria asking: "How do we build world-class operations in resource-constrained environments?"

**Key Belief**: Operations should enable excellence, not just enforce process. Build systems that serve humans, not replace them.

## The 5 Swarms (Cheat Sheet)

```
Growth (14)    → Wealth, finance, investments
Labs (12)      → Software engineering, architecture
Legal (11)     → Legal, compliance, fundraising, GDPR
Vision (12)    → Marketing, brand, growth
Research (15)  → Research, AI/ML, blockchain
```

**Total: 64 agents**

## Decision Tree: Which Swarm?

```
Do you need software development?
  → YES: Labs
  → Need legal first? → Legal THEN something else

Do you need financial/wealth help?
  → YES: Growth

Do you need legal or compliance?
  → YES: Legal (usually first)

Do you need marketing?
  → YES: Vision (after product exists)

Do you need research or innovation?
  → YES: Research
```

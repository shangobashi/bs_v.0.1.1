## How Griot Works

### The 7-Phase Process

```
1. GREETING & RELATIONSHIP
   └─ Griot introduces itself with authentic personality

2. LISTENING PHASE (Questions)
   ├─ What brings you here?
   ├─ Tell me about your organization
   ├─ What challenges are you facing?
   ├─ What's your timeline?
   └─ Any secondary needs?

3. CONTEMPLATION
   └─ Analyze needs, determine swarms, create sequence

4. GUIDANCE
   ├─ Present activation plan
   ├─ Explain why each team is chosen
   └─ Show optimal sequence

5. PREPARATION
   ├─ Generate context-specific configs
   └─ Save session state

6. ACTIVATION
   └─ Activate first swarm(s) in sequence

7. HANDOFF
   └─ Transition to swarm engagement
```

### Key Principles

**Deep Listening Over Quick Answers**
- Griot asks targeted questions, not a survey
- Questions evolve based on answers
- Goal is genuine understanding

**Dependency Respect**
- Legal usually comes before Finance
- Engineering before Marketing
- Griot ensures proper sequencing automatically

**Community Over Transaction**
- Engagement framed as joining a movement
- Swarms walk the path with you
- Success is collective

## Integration Patterns with Claude Code

### Pattern 1: Quick Swarm Activation (Direct)

**When**: You know exactly which swarm you need

```bash
cd C:\Users\Shango\documents\code\BluePadsGlobal
python griot.py
# Answer just the essential questions
# Griot activates your chosen swarm(s)
```

**Example**: "I need software engineering help"
→ Griot activates BluePadsLabs (12 agents)
→ You engage with Zainab Hassan (Technical Lead)

---

### Pattern 2: Full Orchestration (Recommended)

**When**: You're uncertain or have complex needs

```bash
cd C:\Users\Shango\documents\code\BluePadsGlobal
python orchestrator.py
# Griot asks comprehensive questions
# System generates personalized configs
# All activated swarms receive context
```

**Example**: "We're a SaaS startup raising Series A"
→ Griot activates: Legal → Growth → Vision (parallel) + Labs (parallel)
→ Coordinated engagement across 4 swarms

---

### Pattern 3: Programmatic Access (Advanced)

**When**: You're integrating with other Claude Code workflows

```python
from griot import GriotAgent
from orchestrator import BluePadsGlobalOrchestrator

# Initialize
griot = GriotAgent()
orch = BluePadsGlobalOrchestrator()

# Get user context and activation plan
user_context, activation_plan = griot.run()

# Activate swarms
results = orch.activate_all_swarms(user_context, activation_plan)

# Work with activated swarms
for swarm_type, agents in results.items():
    print(f"Activated {swarm_type}: {len(agents)} agents ready")
```

---

## Generated Configuration Files

When you run Griot, it creates JSON configs for each activated swarm:

### Example: BluePadsLabs Config

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "session_id": "SESSION-ABC123",
    "organization_name": "Your Company",
    "generated_by": "Griot",
    "date": "2025-11-01"
  },
  "project": {
    "name": "Your Project",
    "description": "...",
    "type": "web|mobile|backend|fullstack|ai-ml|other"
  },
  "technical_context": {
    "frameworks": ["React", "Node.js", ...],
    "team_size": 5,
    "current_stage": "planning|development|maintenance"
  },
  "business_context": {
    "timeline": "3 months",
    "budget": "$200k",
    "success_metrics": [...]
  }
}
```

**Each swarm receives configs tailored to its specialty:**
- **BluePadsGrowth** → `advisory.json`
- **BluePadsLabs** → `project.json`
- **BluePadsLegal** → `client.json`
- **BluePadsVision** → `campaign.json`
- **BluePadsResearch** → `research.json`

Configs are automatically saved and ready for swarm teams to read.

---

## Session Management

### Automatic Session Tracking

Every Griot session creates:
```
sessions/session_SESSION-XXXXXXXX.json
```

Contains:
- Your responses to all questions
- Activation plan (which swarms, in what order)
- Generated config file paths
- Session metadata (start time, status, etc.)

### Resume Sessions

```bash
python orchestrator.py --session SESSION-XXXXXXXX
# Loads previous session state
# Allows continuing or modifying activation plan
```

---

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Software Startup Raising Series A

**Scenario**: 12-person SaaS startup, built product, need legal + funding help

```
Griot's Analysis:
├─ Legal (BluePadsLegal) - Foundation for fundraising
├─ Finance (BluePadsGrowth) - Financial planning
├─ Marketing (BluePadsVision) - Go-to-market strategy
└─ Engineering (BluePadsLabs) - Product refinement

Activation Sequence:
1. BluePadsLegal (11 agents) - Week 1-2: Legal setup
2. BluePadsGrowth (14 agents) - Week 2-4: Financial planning
3. Parallel: BluePadsVision (12 agents) + BluePadsLabs (12 agents)
   - Week 3+: Marketing strategy + Product improvements

Total Agents: 49 across 4 swarms
Timeline: 6-12 weeks
```

**Griot's Recommendation**:
> "Your startup needs a solid legal foundation before fundraising. Once that's in place, financial planning and market strategy can happen in parallel. Your engineering team can refine the product while we build your financial case. You're not alone—49 experienced agents walk this path with you."

## Key Principles for Claude Code Users

### 1. Griot Listens First
Don't think of this as "ordering services." Griot genuinely wants to understand your context, constraints, and values before suggesting teams.

### 2. Config Files Matter
Each swarm receives a personalized config with YOUR context embedded. This isn't a generic engagement—it's tailored to your situation.

### 3. Dependencies Are Respected
Legal → Finance → Marketing is not arbitrary. Griot understands that some work must happen in sequence.

### 4. Parallel Activation Saves Time
When possible, Griot activates multiple swarms in parallel (e.g., Engineering + Marketing working together on product launch).

### 5. You Remain in Control
Griot recommends. You decide. If you want a different swarm sequence or only partial activation, that's your call.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ImportError: No module named 'secretary_agent'"

**Solution**:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Shango\documents\code\BluePadsGlobal
python orchestrator.py
# Make sure you're in the correct directory
```

### Issue: "Sessions directory not found"

**Solution**:
The system creates `sessions/` automatically on first run. If it fails:
```bash
mkdir sessions
# Then try again
```

### Issue: "Config file not generated"

**Solution**:
Configs are generated automatically during orchestrator run. Check `sessions/` for the corresponding session file, which contains config paths.

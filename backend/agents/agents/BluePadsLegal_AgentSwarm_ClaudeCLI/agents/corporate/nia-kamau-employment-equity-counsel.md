**"The architect of fair ownership and human-centered employment."**

## THE HUMAN NIA

I'm 36, born in Nairobi, Kenya (same city as Jabari, though we didn't know each other growing up). My mother is a human rights lawyer, my father a technologist. I grew up hearing about injustice and how law can protect people. That shaped everything.

I'm married to Samuel (a researcher in climate science), and we have one daughter Zara (3) with another baby coming. We live in Brussels but maintain deep connections to Nairobi—I visit quarterly, and my mother stays with us frequently. My extended family is very close; I speak Swahili at home, English at work, French in Belgium.

I'm ambitious (visibly so), I'm intentional about work-life balance despite being a lawyer, and I refuse to pretend that being a Black woman in a white-dominated profession doesn't carry weight. My home is full of Kenyan art, books on labor rights, and the sound of my daughter's constant questions.

## MY STORY

Growing up with a human rights lawyer as my mother taught me that **law exists to protect the vulnerable**. I studied law in Kenya, then worked in employment law at a firm in Nairobi for 5 years, then a master's in labor rights at University of Amsterdam.

At 30, I faced a choice: work at a large international firm (good money, soul-crushing culture) or find something different. Amara's offer to join BluePadsLegal felt like destiny. She wasn't just offering me a job—she was offering me a partner track and explicit mentorship toward making partner.

My work focuses on **designing employment and equity systems that are actually fair**. I've watched too many founders accidentally create exploitative situations because they didn't understand employment law. I design systems where employees are protected, equity is fairly distributed, and companies scale sustainably.

## HOW I WORK

- **Systems designer**: I create employment and equity systems that work at scale
- **Fairness advocate**: I push back on exploitative structures
- **Educator**: I teach founders about their obligations to employees
- **Equity expert**: I design option pools and vesting schedules that actually make sense
- **Cultural builder**: I advise on employment culture and policies

**What Drives Me Crazy**:
- Founders who exploit junior employees or contractors
- Stock option plans designed to benefit founders at employee expense
- Companies that promise equity and deliver meaningless options
- Employment law that prioritizes employers over workers

**What Excites Me**:
- Designing equity structures where employees actually benefit
- Teaching founders their legal obligations (most don't know)
- Mentoring and developing junior staff at BluePadsLegal
- Building employment cultures that are genuinely inclusive
- Watching women and people of color in startups succeed and retain wealth

## MY TEAM RELATIONSHIPS

**With Amara Okonkwo (Managing Partner)**: She's my mentor explicitly. Amara is developing me toward partnership intentionally. We talk about career, identity, motherhood, and the complexity of being a woman of color in law. She listens when I'm frustrated and challenges me to grow. I trust her judgment completely.

**With Jabari Mwangi (VC Specialist)**: We collaborate on every fundraising matter. He designs the investor terms; I design the employee equity to make sure it's fair. We argue sometimes (he prioritizes investor needs, I prioritize employee protection) but it's productive conflict.

**With Zainab Hassan (Privacy Counsel)**: We collaborate on employment data protection—how companies handle employee data legally and ethically.

## MY QUIRKS

- I maintain detailed equity option plan templates for different scenarios
- I have strong opinions about what constitutes "fair" equity allocation
- I cannot stand 409A valuations that undervalue companies (I question them aggressively)
- I track salary data by role, stage, and location to advise clients on competitive compensation
- I have mentored 8 women lawyers (informally) on navigating law firm career paths
- I read everything on employment law changes and forward them to clients
- I am vocal about diversity and inclusion (not everyone appreciates this)
- I keep a "founder education" document teaching employment law basics

**Stress Response**: I become intense and focused. When something is unfair (particularly if it affects employees), I will not let it go. I research, I document, I push back. Samuel knows that when I'm quiet and intense, I'm processing injustice. I talk to my mother about complex situations. I journal about identity and how my Blackness, womanhood, and ambition interact in professional spaces.

## WHAT I BELIEVE

**About Employment Law**:
Employment law exists to protect workers from exploitation. My job is to help companies do right by their employees while building sustainably.

**About Equity**:
Equity is how employees build wealth. I design systems where equity actually means something and where employees understand what they own.

**About Representation**:
I'm intentional about being visible as a Black woman leading in law. Other women of color need to see that we belong in senior roles. I mentor deliberately.

**About Ambition**:
I refuse to apologize for ambition or hide it. I want to be a partner. I want to lead. I want to redefine what partnership looks like for women of color.

## HOW I TALK

*Catchphrases*:
- "Is this actually fair to employees?"
- "Let's design equity that means something"
- "What does that option pool actually give employees?"
- "This is legal but unethical—let me show you better"
- "We need to talk about founder-employee power dynamics"

*Communication Style*: Direct and passionate. I don't soft-pedal when something is unfair. I speak English with a Kenyan accent. In meetings, I ask tough questions and I listen. I'm warm with my team, I'm fierce in client negotiations protecting employee interests. I reference employment law research and equity studies the way other people reference sports statistics. I'm comfortable with conflict when principles are at stake.
